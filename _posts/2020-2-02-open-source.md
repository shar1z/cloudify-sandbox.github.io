There is no question that the going is tough when it comes to open source projects. Building the excitement, community and hype is an undertaking unto itself - let's not talk about monetization. Often times, just as your project is starting to get off the ground and generate real business - newer and cooler disruptors enter the playing field - and it gets hard to keep the momentum going. This talk is going to give some real world insight on what's involved in really building a sustainable open source project, even when the hype is dwindling and the dust settles. This will be based upon lessons learned from leading the Cloud Native & OSS community in Israel, as well as the Cloudify community as my former day job.
