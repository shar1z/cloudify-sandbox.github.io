I'm a marketing professional, with experience in deep tech, developer relations and product marketing (the other side of the coin), with expertise in open source, DevOps, and cloud native technology.  Some of the things I enjoy most are: empowering engineering organizations and brands, improving developer experience of products, simplifying user journeys, and bringing excellent technology and people together.
